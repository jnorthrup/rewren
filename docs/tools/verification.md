# AI Output Verification Tool

The AI Output Verification tool analyzes AI-generated content using Chain of Thought (COT) logs and provides verification checkpoints based on DORA research findings about AI adoption in software development.

## Overview

This tool helps address the key findings from the 2024 DORA report on AI adoption:

- **95%** of developers use AI assistance
- **80%** report productivity improvements
- **70%** trust AI outputs (concerning given reliability issues)
- **Small steps** with **continuous verification** are recommended

## Usage

The verification tool analyzes different types of AI output and provides:

1. **Confidence scoring** based on content analysis and COT logs
2. **Risk assessment** (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
3. **Verification checkpoints** with specific criteria to check
4. **Recommendations** for safe AI adoption practices
5. **Rollback mechanisms** for high-risk changes

## Parameters

- `outputType`: Type of AI output (`code`, `explanation`, `plan`, `test`, `documentation`, `other`)
- `content`: The AI-generated content to analyze
- `context`: Optional context about what the AI was asked to do
- `cotLogs`: Optional Chain of Thought logs for deeper analysis

## Example Usage

```bash
# Analyze AI-generated code
wren
> Use the verify_ai_output tool to analyze this code: "function add(a, b) { return a + b; }"
```

## Analysis Features

### Content Analysis

- **Code**: Checks for TODOs, debug statements, error handling, structure
- **Tests**: Validates testing framework conventions and assertions
- **Explanations**: Assesses clarity and logical reasoning
- **General**: Detects uncertain language and content quality

### COT Log Analysis

When Chain of Thought logs are available, the tool analyzes:

- Reasoning-to-output ratio (higher ratio = more thorough thinking)
- Reasoning quality assessment
- Confidence calibration based on thinking process

### Risk Assessment

Combines confidence scores with output type to determine risk level:

- **Low**: Safe to proceed with minimal verification
- **Medium**: Standard verification recommended
- **High**: Break into smaller changes, careful review needed
- **Critical**: Strong manual review required, consider rollback mechanisms

## Verification Checkpoints

For each analysis, the tool generates specific checkpoints with:

- **Unique ID** for tracking
- **Action type** (code_change, file_creation, etc.)
- **Confidence score** (0-100%)
- **Verification criteria** (checklist of what to verify)
- **Rollback commands** (when applicable)

## DORA Research Integration

The tool incorporates key insights from the DORA 2024 report:

- Emphasizes incremental development over big-bang changes
- Recommends continuous verification after each AI-assisted step
- Promotes version control and rollback mechanisms
- Addresses the concerning 70% trust rate in AI outputs

## Best Practices

1. **Use for high-risk changes**: Code modifications, new file creation
2. **Verify in small steps**: Don't make multiple AI changes before verification
3. **Review COT logs**: When available, examine the AI's reasoning process
4. **Follow rollback procedures**: Use provided commands for high-risk changes
5. **Combine with human review**: Use as a first line of defense, not replacement for code review

## Integration with Existing Features

The verification tool works seamlessly with:

- **Chain of Thought logging**: Automatically analyzes COT data when available
- **UI coloring**: Reasoning text appears dimmed/italicized for transparency
- **Confirmation dialogs**: Can be integrated with existing safety mechanisms
- **Git integration**: Provides rollback commands using version control

This tool represents a practical implementation of DORA research findings, helping developers adopt AI assistance safely and effectively.
